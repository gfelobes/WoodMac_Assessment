We can determine the data quality based on quantitative and qualitative methods. 

Qualitative methods include data types, formats, encoding, human error, null values, duplicates, make sure the data is timely, complete and coherent
Quantitative methods include looking for outliers, data distribution, appropriate encodings if expected. 


Some of the qualitative reasons include the following:
- Can't open the file using UTF-8 encoding because of special characters due to the presence of sepecial character. 
- Only 99% (dtermined by chardet) of the file could be converted to UTF-8 using notepad ++. 
- Record 76 has the name "Mendoza" in field 15 instead of 14. Whole row is shifted by a column 
- datetime of dates to be specified
- dattype of numeric data needs to be set as float or integer
- Null values as shown below: 
Measured_Depth   1539 non-null   float64
Drilling_Start   889 non-null    object 
Drilling_end     887 non-null    object 
Completion_Date  838 non-null    object 
Reservoir        1998 non-null   object
- well number letter case consistency 
- split field name and field code 
- convert 'unassigned' to Null in reservoir, play_name and state_name 
- check for duplicate values in a column set and subsets
